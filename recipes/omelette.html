        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This cheese omelette is great for breakfast as it is tasty
            and easy to cook.</p><p>When cooking an omelette, it is important 
            that you keep the temperature</p> <p>on the lower side, as you 
            don't want to turn it brown.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 large eggs;</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon milk, or as needed;</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground white pepper to taste;</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter;</li>
            <li>1/4 cup shredded Emmentaler cheese.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Whisk eggs in a bowl; add milk and season with salt and white pepper.</p>
                <p>Whisk until egg mixture is foamy, 2 to 3 minutes.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Melt butter in a small, nonstick skillet over medium-low heat.</p>
                <p>Pour in egg mixture and swirl the skillet, so the bottom is evenly</p>
                <p>covered with egg. Cook until egg starts to set, about 1 minute.</p>
                <p>Lift edges with a spatula and tilt the skillet so uncooked egg can</p>
                <p>flow towards the bottom of the skillet to set. Repeat until no visible</p>
                <p>liquid egg remains.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Carefully flip omelette; cook until warmed through, 30 seconds to 1 minute.</p>
                <p>Sprinkle Emmentaler cheese down the middle of omelette; fold in half. Cook</p>
                <p>until cheese is melted, about 20 seconds. Slide omelette onto a plate.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
